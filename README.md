AzureMobile-Leaderboard
=======================

Automated backend set up for azure mobile leaderboard using azure-scripty. 
The general code flow and Result table action script follow the instructions at http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Adding-a-Leaderboard-to-1f9d216d.


# Getting started

## Install it
```bash
npm install -g azuremobile-leaderboard
```

To set up leaderboard with azure-cli installed and user account downloaded and imported:
```bash
azuremobile-leaderboard
```

The module will create a Leaderboard table and a Result table, configure their action scripts, and download neccessary client-side files in the same directory as where the module is called.

Complete testing scripts coming soon.
